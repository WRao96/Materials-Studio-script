# Materials-Studio-script
All scripts can be executed on server, in order to free your PC
## Forcite.pl
Do molecular dynamics, such as NPT, NVT, N\muT Simulation

## MSD.pl
Calculate Mean Square Displacement calculation, which can be done on PC, while it may cost much time or memory, executing on Server is a better choice obviously.

## SorptionAdsorptionIsotherm.pl
Calculate Isotherm

## SorptionFixedLoading.pl and SorptionFixedPressure.pl
Calculate structure with low energy

## Center.pl 
Dynamics information is stored in '*.trj' file, we can get trajectory information of every center of every molecule by this script.
